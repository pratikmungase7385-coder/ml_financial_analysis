    <h1>About StockAnalyzer</h1>

    <p>
        StockAnalyzer is a financial analysis platform built to help users quickly evaluate companies listed in the NIFTY 100 index. 
        The system collects financial data from public APIs, processes key metrics like sales growth, profit growth, ROE, and stock CAGR, 
        and presents them in a clear, structured format.
    </p>

    <p>
        Instead of showing raw financial statements, the platform highlights meaningful insights such as strengths (Pros) and weaknesses (Cons) 
        based on company performance. This allows investors, students, and analysts to compare companies without digging through complex reports.
    </p>

    <p>
        The project is powered by Python, Flask, MySQL, and REST APIs and is designed to simulate a real-world fintech data pipeline — 
        from API → Database → Web Dashboard.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project is created for learning and research purposes and does not provide investment advice.
